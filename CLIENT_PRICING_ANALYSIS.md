## 1. MANAGEMENT FEE STRUCTURES

### **Standard Pricing Model: 17.5% of Gross Revenue**

**Why 17.5% is the Sweet Spot:**
- **Lower than traditional**: Traditional managers charge 25-35%
- **Higher than DIY cost**: Pure technology costs = ~8-10% of revenue
- **Reflects value delivered**: Technology + expertise + time savings
- **Simple and transparent**: No hidden fees or surprises

**Example Client: 7 Properties Generating $180,000 Annual Revenue**
- **Gross Revenue**: $180,000/year
- **Management Fee (17.5%)**: $31,500/year ($2,625/month)
- **Client Net**: $148,500/year before property expenses

**What's Included in the 17.5%:**
- Full PMS setup and management
- Dynamic pricing optimization
- 24/7 guest communication (93% automated)
- Smart lock management and access control
- Noise monitoring and violation prevention
- Guest screening and risk management
- Cleaner coordination and quality assurance
- Monthly owner reports and dashboard access
- Regular owner communication and strategy calls

**What's NOT Included (Pass-Through Expenses):**
- Cleaning fees (billed directly to guests or owners)
- Maintenance and repairs (billed to owners at cost)
- Utilities (if owner-paid)
- Insurance and property taxes
- Supplies and amenities (if owner-provided)

### **Alternative Pricing Models**

**Tiered Pricing by Portfolio Size:**

| Portfolio Size | Management Fee | Monthly Fee (Example) |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1-3 properties | 20% | $900-2,700 |
| 4-7 properties | 17.5% | $2,100-3,700 |
| 8-10 properties | 15% | $3,600-5,400 |

**Rationale**: Larger portfolios benefit from economies of scale, rewarding clients who trust you with more properties.

**Flat Fee Model (Alternative):**
- **Per Property Monthly Fee**: $375-500/property/month
- **7 Properties**: $2,625-3,500/month
- **Pros**: Predictable for both parties, easier budgeting
- **Cons**: Doesn't scale with revenue optimization, less incentive alignment

**Performance-Based Bonus (Optional Add-On):**
- **Base Fee**: 15% of gross revenue
- **Performance Bonus**: 25% of revenue above baseline
- **Example**: If you increase revenue from $180K to $220K
  - Base fee: $33,000 (15% of $220K)
  - Bonus: $2,500 (25% of $10K increase)
  - Total: $35,500 (16.1% effective rate)

**Why We Recommend Percentage-Based:**
- **Alignment**: Your success = client's success
- **Simplicity**: One number, easy to understand
- **Industry Standard**: What clients expect from management companies

## 8. PRICE SENSITIVITY & POSITIONING

### **Who is NOT Your Client (Price Too High)**

**DIY Enthusiasts:**
- Own 1-3 properties, enjoy managing themselves
- Don't value their time highly ($20-30/hr opportunity cost)
- Price-sensitive, want to save every dollar
- **Not your target**: They should use Hospitable ($20/mo) or self-manage

**Budget Landlords:**
- Own older/lower-end properties generating <$15K/year each
- 17.5% fee = $2,625/year, feels expensive relative to property value
- Can't justify premium technology and service
- **Not your target**: They need budget managers at $200/mo flat fee

---

### **Who IS Your Client (Price is RIGHT)**

**High-Net-Worth Owners:**
- Own 5-10+ properties, portfolio generates $150K-500K/year
- **Value their time** at $100-300/hr (professionals, executives, business owners)
- Understand ROI: $31,500 fee - $50,000 value = $18,500 profit
- Want transparency and control without operational burden

**Busy Professionals:**
- Full-time jobs or businesses, real estate is investment strategy
- Don't want to be "on call" 24/7 for guest issues
- Willing to pay for quality service and peace of mind
- Tech-savvy, appreciate real-time dashboards

**Geographic Investors:**
- Own properties in different cities/states
- Can't physically manage remotely
- Need trusted local operations but centralized oversight
- **Virtual agency model perfect fit**: Technology bridges the distance
