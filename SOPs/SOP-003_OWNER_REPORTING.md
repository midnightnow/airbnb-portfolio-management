- [ ] Export all bookings for previous month (CSV or PDF)
- [ ] Export all expenses (cleaning, maintenance, supplies)
- [ ] Export payout schedule (what platforms paid you)
- [ ] Verify all data is complete (no missing bookings)

**Step 2: Reconcile Platform Payments**

- [ ] Check Vrbo payouts received
- [ ] Check Booking.com payouts received (if applicable)
- [ ] Compare total received vs. total booking revenue in PMS
- [ ] Flag any discrepancies (e.g., Airbnb held payout due to issue)

- [ ] Ensure each expense is assigned to correct property
- [ ] Verify receipts for major expenses (>$100)
- [ ] Flag any unexpected or unusually high expenses

## Section 5: Handling Difficult Conversations

### **Scenario 1: Revenue Down Month-Over-Month**

**Owner's Concern:** "Why is revenue down $2,000 this month?"

**Your Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge & Empathize**
> "I understand your concern. Let me walk you through exactly what happened and what we're doing about it."

**Step 2: Explain with Data**
> "Revenue was down primarily due to two factors:
> 1. January has 10% fewer travel days than December (post-holiday slowdown)
> 2. We had a 5-day gap between bookings at Property A due to a last-minute cancellation
>
> Here's the data: occupancy was 62% vs. 72% last month, but our ADR actually increased by $8."

**Step 3: Contextualize**
> "This is seasonal and expected. Looking at last January, revenue was $X,XXX—this year we're at $X,XXX, which is actually +15% year-over-year. We're trending well."

**Step 4: Action Plan**
> "Here's what we're doing for February:
> • Implemented last-minute discount to fill gaps
> • Increased marketing on Vrbo to capture more bookings
> • Valentine's Day and President's Day premium pricing
>
> I'm projecting February revenue of $X,XXX, which would put us back on track."

**Step 5: Reassure**
> "I monitor this daily and adjust pricing in real-time. You're in good hands, and I'll keep you updated weekly."

---

### **Scenario 2: Owner Questions Management Fee**

**Owner's Concern:** "18% seems high. Can we negotiate a lower rate?"

**Your Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Acknowledge**
> "I appreciate you bringing this up. Let's talk through the value you're getting."

**Step 2: Break Down the Service**
> "Our 18% fee includes:
> • 24/7 guest communication (average response time: 18 minutes)
> • Dynamic pricing optimization (increased your ADR by 23% this year)
> • All technology: PMS, smart locks, noise monitoring
> • Cleaner coordination and quality control
> • Maintenance dispatch and vendor management
> • Monthly reporting and strategic planning
> • Owner portal access for real-time data
>
> If you were to hire an in-house manager, you'd be looking at $60K+ salary plus benefits, which is 32% of your current revenue. We're delivering better results at nearly half the cost."

**Step 3: Show ROI**
> "Let's look at the numbers:
> • Your revenue is up 27% since we took over management
> • Your occupancy is 7 points higher than market average
> • Your rating improved from 4.6 to 4.9
>
> Our fee is paying for itself through better performance. You're netting more money with us at 18% than you were on your own at 0%."

**Step 4: Offer Flexibility (If Appropriate)**
> "That said, I value our partnership. If you're considering expanding your portfolio to 15+ properties, we can discuss a tiered rate (15% for properties 11+). Would that be of interest?"

**Step 5: Confidence**
> "I'm confident we're delivering exceptional value. Let's review the next quarter's performance, and if you're not satisfied, we can revisit this conversation. Fair?"

---

### **Scenario 3: Bad Review from Guest**

**Owner's Concern:** "I just saw a 3-star review. What happened?"

**Your Response Framework:**

**Step 1: Own It**
> "I saw that review too, and I wanted to reach out immediately. Here's what happened and how we're addressing it."

**Step 2: Explain**
> "The guest complained about noise from neighbors. We responded within 20 minutes, contacted the neighbors, and the issue stopped. Unfortunately, the guest left the review before we could fully resolve it.
>
> For context: this is our first sub-4-star review in 6 months across all your properties. Our average is still 4.9/5.0."

**Step 3: Action Plan**
> "Here's what I'm doing to prevent this in the future:
> • Added soundproofing recommendations to our property improvement list
> • Implemented proactive noise monitoring (we now get alerts before complaints)
> • Updated house rules to be more explicit about quiet hours
> • Will reach out to neighbors proactively before each booking"

**Step 4: Perspective**
> "Every property gets a bad review occasionally—it's unavoidable. What matters is:
> 1. We respond professionally (which we did)
> 2. We fix the issue (which we did)
> 3. We maintain a high overall rating (which we are)
>
> Airbnb's algorithm weighs recent reviews more heavily, and we have 4 five-star reviews since then, so this will fade quickly."

**Step 5: Reassure**
> "I take every review seriously and use it as a learning opportunity. Your properties are in great hands, and I'm committed to maintaining our 4.9+ average."
