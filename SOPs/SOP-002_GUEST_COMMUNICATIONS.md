# SOP-002: Guest Communications & Support
## Managing Guest Interactions from Inquiry to Review

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2025-11-11  
**Owner:** Virtual Assistant (VA) / Agency Manager  
**Purpose:** Standardized protocols for all guest communications to ensure 5-star experiences and operational efficiency

---

## Overview

Guest communication is the backbone of your 4.9+ star rating and repeat booking rate. This SOP covers every guest interaction from initial inquiry through post-stay review.

**Core Principles:**
1. **Speed:** Respond within 30 minutes during business hours (8 AM - 10 PM local time)
2. **Professionalism:** Friendly but polished, like a boutique hotel
3. **Proactivity:** Anticipate needs before guests ask
4. **Problem-Solving:** Own issues, fix fast, over-communicate
5. **Consistency:** Every guest gets the same quality experience

**Success Metrics:**
- Response time: <30 minutes (business hours), <2 hours (after hours)
- Guest satisfaction: 4.8+ average rating
- Review rate: 70%+ of guests leave reviews
- Repeat booking rate: 15%+ (return guests)
- Issue escalation rate: <5% (most problems solved by VA)

---

## Section 1: Communication Channels & Tools

### **Primary Channel: PMS Unified Inbox**

**Why:** All OTA messages (Airbnb, Vrbo, Booking.com) flow into one inbox in Hostaway/Guesty

**Setup:**
- [ ] VA has login access to PMS
- [ ] Mobile app installed for after-hours monitoring
- [ ] Push notifications enabled for urgent messages
- [ ] Message tagging system configured (urgent, maintenance, inquiry, etc.)

**Workflow:**
1. Message arrives in unified inbox
2. VA sees notification within 5 minutes
3. VA reads message and categorizes (routine vs. urgent)
4. VA responds or escalates based on type (see below)
5. VA marks message as resolved or flags for follow-up

---

### **Secondary Channels (Rare but Possible)**

**Direct Email:**
- Guests sometimes email directly if they have your contact
- Redirect to PMS: "Please message us through the Airbnb/Vrbo app so we can assist you faster"

**Phone Calls:**
- Only for true emergencies (can't get in, flood, fire, injury)
- Emergency number provided in check-in instructions
- VA or Agency Manager answers, logs issue in PMS

**SMS/Text:**
- Some PMS systems support SMS
- Same response protocols as PMS messages

---

## Section 2: Guest Communication Timeline

### **Pre-Booking: Inquiry Handling**

**Scenario:** Guest hasn't booked yet, asking questions about property

**Response Time Target:** <15 minutes (inquiries have high urgency, they're shopping)

**Common Inquiry Types:**

#### **1. Availability & Pricing Questions**
```
Guest: "Are you available March 15-18? What's the total cost?"

VA Response:
"Hi [Name]! Yes, we're available March 15-18. The total cost for 3 nights is:

Nightly Rate: $185 x 3 nights = $555
Cleaning Fee: $95
Service Fee: (paid to Airbnb)
Total: $650 + Airbnb fees

You can see the full breakdown by entering your dates on the listing. Book soon—we often fill up for that weekend!

Let me know if you have other questions!
Best,
[Agency Name] Team"
```

#### **2. Property-Specific Questions**
```
Guest: "Do you have parking? Is the WiFi good for work?"

VA Response:
"Hi [Name]! Great questions:

🅿️ Parking: Yes! One dedicated spot in the building garage (space #12). Street parking is also available if you have multiple cars.

📡 WiFi: Absolutely—we have 500 Mbps fiber internet, perfect for video calls and remote work. We also have a dedicated workspace with a desk and ergonomic chair.

Anything else I can help with?
Best,
[Agency Name] Team"
```

#### **3. Special Requests**
```
Guest: "Can we bring our small dog? Can we check in early?"

VA Response:
"Hi [Name]!

🐕 Pet: Unfortunately, this property doesn't allow pets due to building rules. However, we have a few pet-friendly properties if you'd like me to recommend one!

⏰ Early Check-In: I'd be happy to accommodate if the property is available. Our standard check-in is 3 PM. What time were you hoping to arrive? Let me check and get back to you!

Best,
[Agency Name] Team"
```

**Note:** Always be helpful, even if the answer is "no." Offer alternatives when possible.

---

### **Post-Booking: Confirmation & Preparation**

**Automated:** Booking confirmation message sent immediately by PMS (see SOP-001)

**Manual Follow-Up (Optional but Recommended):**

**1-2 Days After Booking:**
```
Hi [Name],

Just wanted to say we're excited to host you! I'm [VA Name], and I'll be your main contact during your stay.

Quick reminder: I'll send detailed check-in instructions 48 hours before your arrival. In the meantime, here are a few quick resources:

📖 House Guidebook: [Link]
🗺️ Neighborhood Guide: [Link to Google Map with recommendations]
❓ FAQs: [Link or attachment]

If you have any questions before your arrival, just reply here. I typically respond within 30 minutes!

Looking forward to hosting you!
Best,
[VA Name]
[Agency Name]"
```

**Why:** Proactive outreach builds trust and reduces day-of-arrival questions.

---

### **48 Hours Before Check-In: Critical Instructions**

**Automated:** Pre-arrival message sent by PMS (see SOP-001 templates)

**Manual Checks (VA):**
- [ ] Verify smart lock code generated correctly
- [ ] Confirm cleaning scheduled for checkout day before their arrival
- [ ] Check weather forecast (extreme weather = proactive message)
- [ ] Review guest profile for special notes (birthday, anniversary, etc.)

**Proactive Weather Example:**
```
Hi [Name],

Quick heads up: There's a winter storm warning for [City] this weekend (your check-in dates). Here's what you need to know:

❄️ Roads: Expect snow/ice. Drive carefully or consider rideshare.
🏠 Property: We've stocked extra blankets and the heat is set to 72°F.
🍕 Food: Grocery stores are nearby, but you may want to stock up before the storm.

We're monitoring the situation and here to help if you need anything!

Stay safe,
[VA Name]"
```

---

### **Check-In Day: Active Monitoring**

**VA Workflow (Check-In Day):**

**Morning:**
- [ ] Review all check-ins happening today (list in PMS)
- [ ] Confirm smart lock codes are active
- [ ] Verify cleaners completed yesterday (no issues reported)
- [ ] Flag any properties with maintenance issues (alert guest proactively)

**3:00 PM - 6:00 PM (Prime Check-In Hours):**
- [ ] Monitor messages closely (guests often have questions during check-in)
- [ ] Respond within 5-10 minutes during this window
- [ ] Track successful check-ins (most guests don't message = success)

**Common Check-In Day Issues:**

#### **Issue: Can't Find Property**
```
Guest: "I'm at 123 Main St but I don't see the building number."

VA Response (Immediate):
"Hi [Name]! The building entrance is on the side street (Oak Ave), not Main St. Look for the blue awning. You'll see unit numbers above the door.

Here's a photo of the entrance: [Insert photo]

Are you able to find it now? I'm here if you need more help!
[VA Name]"
```

#### **Issue: Smart Lock Code Not Working**
```
Guest: "The door code isn't working."

VA Response (Immediate):
"Hi [Name]! I'm so sorry for the inconvenience. Let me troubleshoot:

1. Please confirm you're entering: [CODE]
2. Make sure there's no # or * before/after the code
3. Try the code on the keypad (not the app)

If it's still not working, I'll generate a new code right now. Give me 2 minutes!
[VA Name]"

[VA Action: Check smart lock system, regenerate code if needed, send new code immediately]

Follow-Up:
"New code generated: [NEW CODE]. This should work immediately. Please try and let me know!

If you're still having trouble, I can dispatch a local contact with a physical key within 30 minutes. Just say the word!
[VA Name]"
```

**Critical:** Access issues are 5-star rating killers. Fix FAST.

---

### **During Stay: Proactive Support**

**Day 2 Check-In (For Stays 4+ Nights):**

**Automated:** Mid-stay message sent by PMS

**Manual Review:**
- [ ] Check for noise alerts (Minut device)
- [ ] Review any maintenance requests
- [ ] Note any negative signals (guest hasn't responded to messages, etc.)

**Proactive Maintenance Example:**
```
Hi [Name],

Hope you're enjoying your stay! Quick heads up: We noticed the dishwasher isn't draining properly (our system flagged it). I've scheduled a repair technician to come by tomorrow at 2 PM if that works for you?

If you're not home, they can let themselves in and out (takes about 30 minutes). Or we can reschedule if you prefer.

Let me know what works best!
Best,
[VA Name]"
```

### **Handling Guest Issues & Complaints**

**Issue Severity Levels:**

| Level | Definition | Response Time | Who Handles |
|:------|:-----------|:--------------|:------------|
| **Critical** | Safety/security issue, can't access property, flood/fire | Immediate (within 5 min) | Agency Manager (escalate from VA) |
| **Urgent** | Broken AC/heat, no hot water, major appliance failure | <30 minutes | VA coordinates repair, escalates if needed |
| **Moderate** | Minor maintenance, cleanliness issue, missing supplies | <2 hours | VA handles, logs for follow-up |
| **Low** | Questions, recommendations, minor inconvenience | <4 hours | VA handles |

---

#### **Critical Issue Example: No Heat in Winter**

```
Guest: "There's no heat and it's 40 degrees in here."

VA Response (Immediate - within 5 minutes):
"Hi [Name], I'm so sorry—that's completely unacceptable. I'm on it right now.

Here's what I'm doing:
1. Contacting our HVAC technician for emergency service (ETA within 2 hours)
2. Arranging space heaters to be delivered within 30 minutes
3. Checking nearby hotel availability as a backup option

I'll update you every 30 minutes until this is resolved. If you'd prefer to relocate to a hotel tonight (our expense), let me know immediately.

Again, I'm very sorry for this issue. We'll make it right.
[Agency Manager Name]
[Direct Phone: XXX-XXX-XXXX]"

[Immediate Actions by Agency Manager:]
- Call HVAC technician (emergency dispatch)
- Order space heaters via Amazon 1-hour delivery or local hardware store
- Research backup hotel options
- Text/call guest to confirm they received message
- Document everything in PMS
- Prepare refund/discount offer (1 night refund minimum)

Follow-Up (30 minutes later):
"Update: HVAC tech is en route, ETA 6:45 PM. Space heaters arriving at 7:00 PM via local delivery. I'll call you in 10 minutes to check in. Hang tight!"

Resolution Message:
"Hi [Name], heat is back on and thermostat is set to 72°F. Space heaters are also available if you want extra warmth tonight.

To apologize for this, I've issued a full refund for tonight ($185) and a $50 credit for tomorrow. You'll see it on your account within 24 hours.

Is there anything else I can do to make the rest of your stay comfortable?

Again, I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.
[Agency Manager Name]"
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Immediate acknowledgment
- ✅ Clear action plan
- ✅ Frequent updates
- ✅ Backup option offered
- ✅ Proactive compensation
- ✅ Turns disaster into recovery (often results in 5-star review: "Issue happened but they fixed it fast!")

---

#### **Moderate Issue Example: Cleanliness Complaint**

```
Guest: "The bathroom wasn't cleaned properly. There's hair in the tub."

VA Response (Within 30 minutes):
"Hi [Name], I'm very sorry about that. That's not our standard, and I'm addressing it immediately.

I'm sending our cleaning team back within the next 2 hours to re-clean the entire bathroom (and we'll do a full inspection while we're there).

Will you be at the property, or should we let ourselves in? Either way, I'll text you when they arrive and when they leave.

Again, my apologies. This shouldn't have happened.
Best,
[VA Name]"

[VA Actions:]
- Call/text cleaner: "Need you to go back to [Property] ASAP. Guest reported hair in tub. Do a full bathroom re-clean and take before/after photos."
- Offer discount: "I'd also like to offer you a $25 Uber Eats credit for the inconvenience. Does that work?"
- Document in cleaner notes: Flag for quality review

Follow-Up:
"Hi [Name], cleaning team just finished and sent me photos—bathroom is spotless now. Please let me know if there's anything else that needs attention!

Check your email for the $25 Uber Eats code. Enjoy dinner on us!
Best,
[VA Name]"
```

---

### **Check-Out Day: Smooth Transition**

**Automated:** Pre-checkout reminder sent 24 hours before (see SOP-001)

**Manual Review (VA):**
- [ ] Confirm checkout scheduled in PMS
- [ ] Verify cleaning task auto-created for 3 hours after checkout
- [ ] Monitor for late checkout requests

**Late Checkout Request:**
```
Guest: "Can we check out at 1 PM instead of 11 AM? Our flight isn't until 3 PM."

VA Response:
"Hi [Name]! Let me check if we have a same-day check-in.

[If no same-day booking:]
"Good news—the property is available all day, so late checkout at 1 PM works perfectly. No extra charge. Enjoy the extra time!
Best, [VA Name]"

[If same-day booking:]
"Unfortunately, we have guests checking in at 3 PM today, so we need to keep the 11 AM checkout to allow time for cleaning.

However, you're welcome to leave your bags at the property and pick them up later if that helps! Just lock them in the bedroom.
Best, [VA Name]"
```

---

### **Post-Checkout: Review Exchange**

**Goal:** Get 5-star reviews while leaving fair, honest reviews for guests

**Timeline:**

**Day 1 After Checkout:**
- [ ] Cleaner reports on property condition (damage, extra mess, etc.)
- [ ] VA reviews cleaner report
- [ ] VA drafts guest review (see templates below)

**Day 2 After Checkout:**
- [ ] Automated review request sent by PMS
- [ ] VA monitors for guest review submission

**Day 13 (Review Deadline Day):**
- [ ] If guest hasn't reviewed, VA sends gentle reminder:
```
"Hi [Name], hope you made it home safely! We'd love to hear about your stay. If you have a moment to leave a review, it really helps us. Thanks for staying with us!
Best, [VA Name]"
```

---

#### **Guest Review Templates**

**5-Star Guest (No Issues):**
```
"[Name] was a wonderful guest! Great communication, respectful of the property, and left everything in excellent condition. We'd be happy to host them again anytime. Highly recommended! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
```

**Good Guest (Minor Issue but Resolved):**
```
"[Name] was a great guest. There was a small misunderstanding about [issue], but we worked it out quickly. They were respectful and communicative. Would host again!"
```

**Problematic Guest (Damage or Rule Violation):**
```
"[Name] was generally communicative, but unfortunately, they [violated house rule/caused damage]. We documented this with photos and filed a claim with Airbnb. Future hosts should be aware."
```

**Note:** Always be professional in reviews. Avoid emotional language, stick to facts.

---

## Section 3: Tone & Voice Guidelines

### **Brand Voice: "Boutique Hotel Meets Friendly Neighbor"**

**Do:**
- ✅ Use guest's first name
- ✅ Be warm but professional
- ✅ Use clear, simple language
- ✅ Empathize with issues ("I understand how frustrating that must be")
- ✅ Over-communicate during problems
- ✅ End with your name (builds personal connection)

**Don't:**
- ❌ Use slang or overly casual language ("yo," "hey buddy")
- ❌ Use ALL CAPS or excessive exclamation points!!!
- ❌ Blame the guest (even if it's their fault)
- ❌ Say "it's policy" (explain the why instead)
- ❌ Respond emotionally to rude guests (stay professional)
- ❌ Use passive voice ("This will be addressed" vs. "I'm addressing this now")

---

### **Response Examples by Tone:**

#### **Too Casual:**
```
❌ "Hey dude, yeah we're cool with that. Just shoot me a text when u get there lol"
```

#### **Too Formal:**
```
❌ "Dear Mr. Smith, Your inquiry has been received and is currently under review. We will respond within 24-48 business hours. Regards, Management."
```

#### **Just Right:**
```
✅ "Hi John! Yes, that works perfectly. Just message me when you arrive and I'll send the code. Looking forward to hosting you!
Best, Sarah"
```

## Section 4: Emergency Protocols

### **True Emergencies (Immediate Escalation to Agency Manager)**

**Definition:** Situations requiring immediate human intervention, not just messaging

**Types:**
1. **Guest Safety:** Injury, medical emergency, fire, flood, break-in, assault
2. **Property Safety:** Flood, fire, gas leak, structural damage
3. **Legal Issues:** Police involvement, domestic dispute, eviction threat
4. **Severe Access Issues:** Can't get in after multiple attempts, stranded outside in extreme weather

**VA Protocol:**
1. Immediately text/call Agency Manager (even after hours)
2. Respond to guest: "I'm escalating this to my manager right now. They'll call you within 5 minutes at [guest phone]."
3. Document everything in PMS with "EMERGENCY" tag
4. Do NOT attempt to resolve alone

---

### **Agency Manager Emergency Response:**

**Step 1: Assess (within 5 minutes)**
- Call guest directly to assess situation
- Determine severity: Does this need 911? Local emergency contact? Or just fast coordination?

**Step 2: Act (within 15 minutes)**
- **If 911 needed:** Instruct guest to call, then you call to report as property manager
- **If local help needed:** Dispatch plumber/locksmith/handyman with "emergency" request
- **If relocation needed:** Offer hotel, arrange booking immediately

**Step 3: Document**
- Log all actions in PMS
- Take photos/screenshots of messages
- Prepare incident report for insurance claim if needed

**Step 4: Follow-Up**
- Check in every 30-60 minutes until resolved
- Proactive compensation (refund/discount)
- Document resolution for future prevention

---

## Section 5: Escalation Matrix

**When VA Handles Alone:**
- ✅ Routine inquiries (parking, WiFi, recommendations)
- ✅ Minor maintenance (reported but not urgent)
- ✅ Guest questions during stay
- ✅ Review requests
- ✅ Check-in/check-out coordination

**When VA Escalates to Agency Manager:**
- ⚠️ Guest complaint that could result in bad review
- ⚠️ Maintenance issue requiring >$200 repair
- ⚠️ Cleanliness complaint
- ⚠️ Damage report from cleaner
- ⚠️ Request for refund or discount

**When VA Escalates Immediately (True Emergency):**
- 🚨 Safety issue (guest or property)
- 🚨 Legal issue
- 🚨 Severe access problem
- 🚨 Guest threatening bad review or demanding refund

---

## Section 6: Common Scenarios & Scripts

### **Scenario 1: Noise Complaint from Neighbor**

```
Neighbor (via platform message): "Your guests are being loud. It's 11 PM and I have work tomorrow."

VA Response (Immediate):
"Hi [Neighbor Name], I'm very sorry about that. I'm contacting the guests right now to remind them of quiet hours.

If it continues, please call me directly: [Phone]. I take this seriously and will address it immediately.

Thank you for letting me know.
[VA Name]"

[VA Action: Message guests immediately]

"Hi [Guest Name], we received a noise complaint from a neighbor. I know you're having fun, but please keep noise to a minimum after 10 PM out of respect for neighbors. Thanks for understanding!"

[If noise continues → Agency Manager calls guest directly]
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Guest Locked Out (Lost Code)**

```
Guest: "I can't find the door code. Can you resend it?"

VA Response (Immediate):
"Hi [Name]! No problem, here it is:

Door Code: 5678#
(Press # after entering the code)

Wi-Fi: [Network] | Password: [Password]

Let me know if you have any trouble!
[VA Name]"
```

---

### **Scenario 3: Guest Wants Recommendation**

```
Guest: "What's a good restaurant nearby?"

VA Response:
"Hi [Name]! Here are my top 3 picks:

🍕 **Pizza Perfecto** (2 blocks away)
- Best wood-fired pizza in the neighborhood
- $15-25 per person
- Reserve on OpenTable

🍜 **Ramen House** (10-min walk)
- Amazing ramen and cocktails
